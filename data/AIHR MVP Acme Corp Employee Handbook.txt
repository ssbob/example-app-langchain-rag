Always ensure your appearance reflects the professionalism and standards of Acme Corp.
In addition, employees are encouraged to take personal responsibility for their actions and to contribute positively to the workplace environment. This includes being punctual, meeting deadlines, and striving for excellence in all tasks. By upholding these standards, we can maintain a productive and harmonious workplace that benefits everyone.
3. Time Off and Holidays
1. Paid Time Off (PTO): Acme Corp offers 25 days of paid time off per year, which can be used for vacation, sick leave, or personal days.

In addition to these federal holidays, Acme Corp may offer floating holidays that can be used at the employee's discretion, subject to approval.
Employees are also entitled to take leave for other personal or family emergencies, subject to the company's leave policies. For long-term or extended leaves, such as maternity or paternity leave, employees should consult the HR department to understand their entitlements and the procedures for applying for such leave.
We strive to support our employees in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Taking time off is crucial for personal well-being and productivity, and we encourage you to make use of your leave entitlements to achieve this balance.
